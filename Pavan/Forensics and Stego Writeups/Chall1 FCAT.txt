Solution:

We get two files one is hashes.txt another is a password protected zip file.
Analysing the hashes it is md5 , cracking the hashes we get 2 words
1)jetpack
2)fishtail
Since the pass is 1+2
'jetpackfishtail' is the password for zip file

Using this password we crack the zip file , we get an corrupted png image file

We need to change the .PNG , IHDR, IEND headers to get the image

After correcting it we get our flag.
