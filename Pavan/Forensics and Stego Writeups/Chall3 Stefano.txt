Challenge: Stefano

Description:

Solution:

So we are given a audio file , doing spectrum techniques won't work , so we have to look for Audio Steganography Techniques.
There is an interesting tool for Audio Steganography
Here is the link!
https://github.com/danielcardeenas/AudioStego
After Downloading using the command

./hideme _____ -f

We will get an image ( So far so good!)
Using stegcracker or Stegseek and rockyou.txt as wordlist , we will get the password as "http://apps.rockyou.com/photofx.swf"
So using this as password , we use Steghide 

We get a flag.png as the output file
Its just a text file with extension .png

In that text file , we get the flag in it
But here is the twist , it is encoded in rot87 (Lil bit of Crypto)
Here is the link for decoding it
https://www.dcode.fr/rot-cipher
Change the options to '94 PRINTABLE ASCII CHARACTERS FROM ! (33) TO ~ (126) (IE: ROT47)'
Decode it and we will get the flag

FLAG: TamilCTF{4udi0_St3g_R0ckY0u_St3g}
